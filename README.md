# Reddit Gallery

A simple test app which calls Reddit's apis to fetch images from subreddits and display them in a gallery.

This app uses MSLoadingHUD, a library I've developed while developing this app, and published it as pod and Swift Package. More info here: [https://github.com/marcosiino/MSLoadingHUD.git](https://github.com/marcosiino/MSLoadingHUD.git)
